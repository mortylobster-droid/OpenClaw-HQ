## How "Save Link" Workflow Works

### Option 1: Via Telegram
```
You: "Save this: https://example.com/tool"
Me: 
  1. Fetch the page
  2. Extract title
  3. Generate AI description
  4. Suggest tags/category
  5. Save to Notion Resources Hub
  6. Reply: "✅ Saved! Title, Category, Description"
```

### Option 2: Auto-categorization
I can analyze the URL and suggest:
- Category: #automation #n8n #ai
- Description: AI-generated summary
- Tags: Based on content analysis
