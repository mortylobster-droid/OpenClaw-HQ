## Key Outcomes

### ✅ Completed
1. **Fixed n8n Domain**
   - Deleted old tunnel (ricksanchezautomations.com - not purchased)
   - Created new tunnel: n8n-morty (mortyautomations.com)
   - Updated Hostinger nameservers to Cloudflare
   - Added CNAME record in Cloudflare
   - **Result:** https://n8n.mortyautomations.com is LIVE

2. **Security Framework Implementation**
   - Reviewed ClawSec and IronClaw repos for best practices
   - Created SECURITY.md (comprehensive guidelines)
   - Implemented practical security tools:
     - `secure-curl.sh` - Endpoint-validated curl wrapper
     - `security-audit.sh` - Weekly security scan
     - `browser-automation.sh` - Safe browser automation
   - Updated weekly-summary.sh to include security audit
   - Pushed all to GitHub

### 🔐 Security Controls Now Active
- Browser automation approval required for logged-in sites
- Network endpoint allowlisting
- Credential file audit (600 permissions verified)
- Weekly security audits (Sundays via Telegram)
- File system sandbox restrictions
- Command execution risk classification

## Domain Status

| Domain | Status | URL |

## Security Highlights

**Addressed User Concern:** Yesterday I opened Safari tabs while user was logged into ChatGPT, Gmail, etc.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Browser automation now requires explicit approval when sensitive sites detected
- Private window mode available for safe automation
- All browser actions logged to ~/.openclaw/logs/browser-automation.log

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| mortyautomations.com | User already owns domain in Hostinger |
| Browser approval workflow | User concern about logged-in accounts |
| Weekly security audits | Proactive security monitoring |
| Endpoint allowlisting | Prevent unauthorized network access |

## Next Steps
- User going to gym
- Continue tomorrow with more automation workflows
- Reviewer agent (Morty) can review security framework
